My personal search bot crawling twitter for infoSec news.

It tries to sort all tweets from worst to best tweet by giving them a score 
depending on their contents , nbr of followers , retweets , favorites , language , media etc ...

Then Sends me a dm when done retweeting all the good stuff in its timeline .
